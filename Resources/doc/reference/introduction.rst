Introduction
============

``SonataClassificationBundle`` offers the ability to organise your entities in `Categories`, `Collections` or `Tags` (see :doc:`classification_types`).

You may find several usage examples in other Sonata bundles, such as `SonataNewsBundle <https://github.com/sonata-project/SonataNewsBundle>`_; `Sonata E-commerce <https://github.com/sonata-project/ecommerce>`_ and so on.
